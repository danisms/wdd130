            Hello Everyone &#9995;<br> 
            <p>My name is Daniel C. Opute, I am 22 years old and I am from Nigeria, currently resides in Benin City, Edo state.
                I am the second-to-last child of my parents seven children, I am single and hope to find someone to marry someday.
                I recently returned home from my Full-time Missionary service about a year ago, and the experiences I had during my 
                service is still very fresh in my mind, and I am most grateful to God for them. 
                I love music, and I'm blessed with the talent to play three different musical instruments, which are the piano, 
                recorder, and ukulele.</p> 
            <p>It is my great privilege to study this course (Web Foundamentals) with you all. I feel really optimistic about 
                the course, and I truly appreciate our instructorsâ€™ advice on how to succeed at the introduction of the course,
                and also the great moltivational video he shared too that was really inspiring. I really look forward to learning,
                meeting, and getting to know you all.</p>
            <p>I'd like to share a principle that I intend to use in this course.
                I once had an amazing experience that taught me a valuable lesson. 
                That experience taught me that no matter what challenges we face, if we seek the Lord's help, 
                He will inspire our minds on how to overcome them, and if we faithfully follow the inspirations 
                we receive from Him, He will provide ways for us to overcome the difficulties we may face in doing so. 
                So, with this truth in mind, I will continue to seek the Lord's guidance when I confront challenges 
                along this course, and I will faithfully and diligently follow the promptings I shall receive from 
                the Lord as I strive to become who He wants me to be. <br>Thank you. &#128513;</p>
