                            Hello! My name is Daniel C. Opute. I am a passionate web designer and an aspiring full-stack web developer 
                            with a passion for creating user-friendly and responsive web-sites. My love for programming stems from my 
                            passion and desire to build things. Right from my childhood, I have loved games and activities that require 
                            creating or building stuff, and this has helped me develop into who I am today. It is nice having you here 
                            in this section of my site. Here I will answer a list of questions you may want to ask me, and if you are not 
                            satisfied with the answers given or would like to know more, then feel free to contact me. It is indeed a 
                            delight to serve you. Thank you.
                        </p>

                <h3>How long have you been into web development?</h3>
                <p>
                    Well, officially, it’s about a year and three months now. 
                    I first started learning about web design and development in 2018, and it piqued my interest, so I dug into it. 
                    A year later, I helped a company named MegaSoftTouch Global Resources, an industrial cleaning company, 
                    create their first website, which was hosted but later brought down due to a lack of maintenance sustainability. 
                    This happened due to my absence for a two-year missionary’ service I rendered for the Lord. 
                    So I said officially a year and six months because I went back into web development when I returned, which is 
                    about a year and three months now.

                <h3>How proficient are you with designs?</h3>
                <p>
                    I will say intermediate due to the fact that I haven’t designed very 
                    complex designs yet, though I am looking up to doing so.

                <h3>Aside from web development, what else do you have an interest in or passion for?</h3>
                <p>
                    I love music a lot.<br>
                    I am blessed with the talent to play three different musical instruments, namely, a piano, a recorder or flute, 
                    a wind instrument, and a ukulele or mini-guitar, as some of my friends will call it. I am blessed with a really 
                    nice singing voice, and I am a member of a stake choir and also a musical band. Aside from music, 
                    I also love to draw, dance, play video games, and spend quality time with my family and loved ones.
