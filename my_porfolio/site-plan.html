      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to Danism-Web's “About Me” section.<br>
        Hello! My name is Daniel C. Opute. I am a passionate web designer and an aspiring full-stack web developer 
        with a passion for creating user-friendly and responsive web-sites. My love for programming stems from my 
        passion and desire to build things. Right from my childhood, I have loved games and activities that require 
        creating or building stuff, and this has helped me develop into who I am today. It is nice having you here 
        in this section of my site. Here I will answer a list of questions you may want to ask me, and if you are not 
        satisfied with the answers given or would like to know more, then feel free to contact me. It is indeed a 
        delight to serve you. Thank you.<br><br>
        Below is a list of questions asked by potential collaborators, and my answers are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>How long have you been into web development?<br>Well, officially, it’s about a year and three months now. 
            I first started learning about web design and development in 2018, and it piqued my interest, so I dug into it. 
            A year later, I helped a company named MegaSoftTouch Global Resources, an industrial cleaning company, 
            create their first website, which was hosted but later brought down due to a lack of maintenance sustainability. 
            This happened due to my absence for a two-year missionary’ service I rendered for the Lord. 
            So I said officially a year and six months because I went back into web development when I returned, which is 
            about a year and three months now.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>How proficient are you with designs?<br>I will say intermediate due to the fact that I haven’t designed very 
            complex designs yet, though I am looking up to them.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Aside from web development, what else do you have an interest in or passion for?<br>I love music a lot. 
            I am blessed with the talent to play three different musical instruments, namely, a piano, a recorder or flute, 
            a wind instrument, and a ukulele or mini-guitar, as some of my friends will call it. I am blessed with a really 
            nice singing voice, and I am a member of a stake choir and also a musical band. Aside from music, 
            I also love to draw, dance, play video games, and spend quality time with my family and loved ones.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Why should I work with you?<br>My ability to be attentive to details is something I so much admire in me. 
            If you work with me, you will get a detailed, if not perfect, near-perfect job delivered to you that will 
            meet your demands and satisfaction.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>How can I contact you?<br>You can contact me with the options provided in the "Contact Me" section of this website.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>What qualifications do you have?<br>The portfolio section of this website holds my qualifications in detail; 
            please endeavor to view it.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Do you have samples that show what you can do?<br>The "Projects" section of this website are a visual display of 
            my projects, works, and more. There are samples of what I can do there. Do endeavor to view it.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Why should I trust you?<br>Trust, as some wise men would say, is "earned and not demanded” 
            I believe my work is capable of earning your trust. All I need is for you to take a leap of faith in me.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><li>What level of web development are you at?<br>I am a passionate web designer, 
          and I firmly hope to become a full-stack web developer.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><li>What experience do you have?<br>The "Portfolio" section of this website holds my experience and qualifications. 
          Please do endeavor to view it.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        To learn more about me, please feel free to contact me by selecting from my contact options provided in the 
        "Contact Me" section of this website. Thank you. Once again, it is indeed a delight to serve you.
